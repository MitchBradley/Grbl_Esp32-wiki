### Guidelines for creating pull requests.

#### Branches

Please target the devt branch with your pull requests. All new changes and features are staged in the devt branch before merging to the master branch. 

For experimental features, it is also acceptible to target other, non master, branches.

#### File names

If files need to be renamed from standard grbl file names due to conflicts with libraries, etc, please prefix the old filename with "grbl_". **Example:** limits.h has a conflict, so limits.h and limits.cpp were renamed to grbl_limits.h and grbl_limits.cpp
