## Compiler Errors

### Why do I get this error (or similar) when compiling "'class SSDPClass' has no member named 'end'"?

This error is due to improper installation of required libraries. See the [Copy Libraries](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/wiki/Compiling-the-firmware) section of the Compiling the Firmware Wiki page.
