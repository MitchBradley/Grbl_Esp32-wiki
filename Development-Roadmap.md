Here is a list of things that are considered likely to make it into the firmware. If you would like to work on anything here, please let us know on the Slack channel (request an invite, if needed). If you think something should be added to this list, please suggest it on Slack or start a new [issue](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/issues).

## System Level


## Grbl
